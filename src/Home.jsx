            This name is William Castro the developer of over 2 years of learning the adventures of coding and learning how to program! It has been an interesting journey. So far this is now my second attempt and learning React! The first time was over 1 year ago around June or July and this was before the explosion which occured with Next.js being used along side React. This was the error where React had just left React as a class base system and just became known as React hooks! I started maybe 1 or 2 years after this development to learn React. Infact I made a React Caculator last year using React. Now things are a little bit different with React. Instead of creating your project with npx create react app. Now we use something called Vite for our projects. I forgot the implementation in how you start since now I am so fairly new to this new process since I began officialy learning React again on December 28th of 2023. To my understanding this new process with React is suppose to make things easier, we shall see!
