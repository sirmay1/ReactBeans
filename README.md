# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

PERSONAL NOTES: This is a starter project in learning how to "REACT" with React.js As I learn from this Udemy course with Maximillian Schwartz who is teaching this course. I am trying to create small modules, props and learn the fundamentals of React. Later I will delete all the content on this App file and restart from stratch by making a new project with everything which was taught by this tutorial. (01/07/2024)...
