NOTE: Learning React and practicing my commits by pushing up this tutorial so I get better at version control. BUT after I understanding enough of React I will turn this application of study into an actual project. I am just simple documenting my learning progress and eventually be able to produce a fully functional SPA application using React. Only time will tell.
